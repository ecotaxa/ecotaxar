# ecotaxar

An R package to access data from [EcoTaxa](https://ecotaxa.obs-vlfr.fr).

## Installation

Not (yet?) on CRAN, so to install:

```
remotes::install_github("ecotaxa/ecotaxar")
```

## Usage

Most functions require direct access to the database, which is currently only possible from the internal network of Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie de Villefranche (LOV). Functions will be slowly moved to using the API.
